    "permissions": {
        "is_superuser": true,
        "is_driver": false,

```

### Successful Response
```json

```

## Save restaurant withdrawal history

the request update the withdrawal history of the restaurant.
This can be achieved thus:
### Endpoint /auth/restaurants/me/withdrawals/ POST and GET
A POST request will send the list of withdrawals made by a particular restaurant given 
the token is correct. Note that, like every other restaurant view, only restaurant users
can make this request to the backend. Note that this is actually the withdrawal deduction made from 
flutterwave.

            "address": "",
            "balance": 0.0
        },
        "user": 1
    }
]


```

  "account_number": "54534543490",
  "amount": 600,
  "currency": "NGN",
  "narration": "Payment for things"
}
```

## Detail PUT and DELETE request --- 
### Endpoint /auth/restaurants/me/withdrawals/(id)/ PUT and GET and DELETE

This returns a single item from the withdrawal history as:

```json

        "id": 2,
        "account_bank": "9001",
        "account_number": "54534543490",
        "amount": 600,
        "currency": "NGN",
        "narration": "Payment for things",
        "reference": "XYJKSGJJAHHSHJKSJ",
        "restaurant": {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "",
            "description": "",
            "ratings": 0,
            "image_url": null,
            "address": "",
            "balance": 0.0
        },
        "user": 1
    }

```
The endpoint takes in the `id` of a single item in the withdrawal history and 
returns it as the above json object.

A `DELETE` operation can also be performed on the withdrawal history by calling the `DELETE` HTTP Method.




### Error Response:

```json
{"messge": "User must be a restaurant or chef"}
{"message": "Restaurant does not exists."}
{"message": "Http method not allowed"}
{"message": "Restaurant Withdrawal does not exists."}


```

```json
{"message": "Restaurant withdrawal history deleted successfully"}
```
A successful response could also return the object created and a successful
status code of 200 OK Response.


###

## Get and Update Driver Profile information
  
To get driver info, you need to provide a valid token in the authorization header.
And you must ensure that user is a driver/logistics. If it's not a driver you will receive a permission denied message.

Note that this view is for the logged in driver user is updating its data.
This user can also update profile information like profile picture and others
with this endpoint: `/auth/users/me/`. Remember this enpoint is used to retrieve and modify profile data.
### Endpoint /auth/drivers/me/ GET

No payload required for a GET request.
### Endpoint /auth/drivers/me/ PUT
Payload should look like this:
```json
{
  
  "vehicle_color": "Gold",
  "vehicle_description": "Vehicle Description",
  "vehicle_number": "GLU23HS",
  "available": true,
  
}
```

Do not add `driver_id` here. This endpoint is for changing kitchen details, not changing kitchen_id.
To change driver_id, use the previous endpoint given: `/auth/users/change/username/`.

The following response will be received if an error occured:
```json
{"message": "User was not found"}
{"message": "User must be a chef. Permission denied."}
{"message":"You are not allowed to update driver id via this route"}
```

Some other error responses will also occur if the user data do not meet the validation score.


# List of Restaurants and Dishes
  
For all endpoints, the client must make request with a valid token in the Authorization header.

## Restaurants
### /api/restaurants/ GET
The above enpoint retrieves the list of restaurants and their information for all users to see.
The only constraint here is that users are only allowed to access it with their token in the `Authorization` header. If no token is found in the Authorization request header, a  `Authentication credentials were not provided` response  will be raised or a `Invalid token` response if the token in the header is invalid. The JSON object returned from this request as response is as follow:

```json

{
    "count": 2,
    "next": null,
    "previous": null,
    "results": [
        {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "Kada Plaza",
            "description": "This is Kada Plaza",
            "ratings": "0.0",
            "image": null,
            "address": "ReyversKitchen's Kitchen Address"
        },
        {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "ReyversKitchen",
            "description": "This is ReyversKitchen",
            "ratings": "3.0",
            "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/dqevhwn0e/image/upload/v1/media/restaurant/Screen_Shot_2024-01-24_at_3.16.15_PM_hyvbl7",
            "address": "ReyversKitchen's Kitchen Address"
        }
    ]
}

```
The response above `count` represents the number of items in the list or array data structure. 
The `next` indicate the endpoint for the next set of items; `prev` does quite the opposite.


### /api/restaurants/(id)/ GET

    ]
}

```


For a POST request, you can decide to use a formData to send your request with the following body parameters `name`, `images`, `description`, `price`, `restaurant`, `category` and payload:

```json
{
  "name":"Rice",
  "description":"This is the best food you have ever tasted",
  "price":4000,
  "restaurant":1,
  "category":2,
  "delivery_options":"paid",
  "time_duration":20,
  "images": "[ListOfImages base64]",
  "ingredients":[1,2,3,4],
  "all_images": [
    "https://f.com/fgh.png",
    "https://f.com/fgh.png",
    "https://f.com/fgh.png"
  ]
}

```
The `images` field is best handled using formData. But you can use it in other ways based on your use case.

You have an option to send an array of images in the `all_images` field.


The `ingredients` field is a list or array of ids. Each id must be attributed to an ingredient instance, meaning you must first fetch the ingredients, retrieve their ids and make a request.

### /api/dishes/(id)/ GET

The `id` parameter is used to get a specific dish. If a non-existent id is not provided, a 404 NOT FOUND response would be received by the client. In order to avoid this the right id must be given.


The expected response gotten will be as follows:


```json

{
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Swallow fufu",
    "description": "This is the description",
    "price": "3000.00",
    "restaurant": 1,
    "ratings": "0.0",
    "favourite": [],
    "_ingredients": [
        "onions",
        "carrot",
        "green peas"
    ],
    "restaurant_details": {
        "name": "",
        "ratings": 0.0
    },
    "get_category": {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "english meals",
        "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/dqevhwn0e/image/upload/v1/media/category/Screen_Shot_2024-01-24_at_3.14.41_PM.png"
    },
    "image_urls": [
        {
            "id": 4,
            "url": "https://f.com/fgh.png"
        },
        {
            "id": 5,
            "url": "https://f.com/fgh.png"
        },
        {
            "id": 6,
            "url": "https://f.com/fgh.png"
        }
    ],



    "images": [
        {
            "id": 3,
            "file": "https://res.cloudinary.com/dqevhwn0e/image/upload/v1/media/category/Screen_Shot_2024-01-24_at_3.14.41_PM.png",
            "label": ""
        }
    ],
    "category": 1
}

```
### /api/dishes/(id)/ GET, PUT, DELETE
Get request retrieves a single item by `id`.
The delete and the put requests are used for updating or permanently deleting the dish item.

The PUT request has a payload similar to that of the POST request, altghough you must ensure that
that every request ends in a slash (/).
  


# Categories
  
## /api/categories/ GET, POST
For Categories, the above endpoint can be used to likewise perform POST and GET operations.
The endpoint retrieves all the category data in the database. It also creates new categories with unique names. This depends on the method used in the request, whether a GET or POST request.

The Payload the client should expect to receive from a GET request is as follows:

```json
{
    "count": 1,
    "next": null,
    "previous": null,
    "results": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "english meals",
            "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/dqevhwn0e/image/upload/v1/media/category/Screen_Shot_2024-01-24_at_3.14.41_PM.png"
        }
    ]
}

```

Here, every category returns a paginated response of `id`, `name` and `image` in the payload.

Post request, on the other hand, does a different thing. It creates a new `category` with the following payload:

```json
  {
    "name": "traditional dishes",
    "image": "<FileData base64>"
  }

```
After being created, the response will contain the payload created.



## /api/categories/(id)/ GET, PUT, DELETE
The GET request will retrieve a single item based on the id provided as parameter.

The delete and the put requests are used for updating or permanently deleting categories.
The delete request does not need any payload, only the `id` parameters is received by the backend service and act upon. 

The PUT request, on the other hand requires a payload, same as the POST request.


# Pagination
</summary>
  
The pagination is used with Query Parameters like:

`https://example.com/api/categories/?page_size=10&page=1`

Those are the default values for `page` and `page_size`. There is usually 10 items in one page. If your page is 2, I guess you'll receive the next 10 items, depending on your page size. If your `page_size` is 20, it means you want 20 items per page...


And the `‚Å†count` attribute is used to tell the number of items there are per page. So with it you can set a limit to your frontend, make it not fetch anymore data once you've arrived at the `‚Å†count‚Å†`.

# PAYMENT INTEGRATION WITH STRIPE
  
In order for payments to be processed a payment intent must be created using strip.
The client should send an object containing the amount the total amount to be paid 
to the server with the following url endpoint:

## /api/payment/intent/ POST
```json
{
  "amount": 2000,
  "currency_code": "usd"
}

```
The above amount value `2000` in the payload represent `20 usd` which is equivalently `20 * 100` or `{total} * 100`. 
After the payment intent has been created, the client will get back a success response with the following response body :

```json
  {
    "payment_intent_secret": "pi_3OhHi24eGaAoGO3h0u6gK1j_secret_sNrZa3Vl0XQj9dDoCRTWERZSo"
  }

```

### Potential error responses:
These errors occur when a currencies with relatively low exchange rate like Naira is used with stripe.

```json
{
    "message": "Something went wrong: Request req_8xS8MfJKBnov7c: Amount must convert to at least 50 cents. 0.20 ‚Ç¶ converts to approximately ‚Ç¨0.00."
}

{
    "message": "Something went wrong: Request req_IpeDAKfFWG8KQw: Amount must be no more than 999,999.99 ‚Ç¶"
}

{
    "message": "Something went wrong: Unexpected error communicating with Stripe.  If this problem persists,\nlet us know at support@stripe.com.\n\n(Network error: ConnectionError: ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')))"
}

```

- The first error response would occur only when the amount in naira is relatively lesser than 50 American cents.
- The second error response, on the other hand, would occur if the value in naira is greater than ‚Ç¶999,999.

- The fourth is as a result of network error.


# Create orders
  
## /api/orders/ POST
When a customer creates an order, the client should send the following payload to the backend service:

```json
  {
    "total_price": 6800,
    "payment_status": true,
    "is_delivered": false,

    "items": [
        {
            "dish_id": 1,
            "restaurant_id": 1,
            "amount": 400,
            "quantity": 2
        },
        {
            "dish_id": 3,
            "restaurant_id": 1,
            "amount": 3000,
            "quantity": 2

        }
    ]

}

```
`payment_status` is a boolean value.
It should be set to `true` if payments were successfull.

`is_delivered` status can be modified later, but its default value is `false`. 

The `total_price` must correllate with the total price of all the `items` in the `items` array.
This is to say the `total_price` must be `(item[0].amount * item[0].quantity) + (item[2].amount * item[2].quantity)`. If there is no correlation, an error response would be raised.


For each item in the array of items in the payload, the `dish_id` field is the id of the dish you are sending from the cart data. The `restaurant_id` is the unique id of the restaurant. Please note that this is not the same as the `kitchen_id`. The `kitchen_id` is only used for user authentiction. 

## Response body
```json

{
    "id": 66,
    "user": 2,
    "total_price": 6800,
    "created_at": "2024-02-08T12:53:28.862377Z",

# Get Recent order items
  
## /api/orderitems/ GET
## /api/orderitems/(id)/ GET

The response from the order items endpoint is dependent on the authenticated user based on the auth token provided in the http header. 

In order to fetch the user's orders, whether they be driver, restaurant or customer, the client should send a GET request to the above endpont.
How this works is that the user will see all his orders and can also get the detail of orders if they request based on the `id`. 

## Response Body

```json
[
    {
        "id": 66,

### Using Query Parameters to determine the nature of response
  
In order to get the orderitems that should be listed as `history` or `ongoing`, query parameters are used in the request.
For instance, if you intend on getting historical data of the order items, you should send your request to the orderitems endpoint and a query parameter should be sent as well as follows:

### /api/orderitems/?option=history GET
Or
### /api/orderitems/?option=ongoing GET
Note that `option` is the key and `ongoing` or `history` are the values of the query.
The query parameters will determine the result gotten from the response body.
The `ongoing` option will return `pending` orders. 
The `history` option, on the other hand, will return all the orders that are that are either `completed` or `cancelled`.

This is the same for all users.

### Orders can also be updated via a PUT request.
## /api/orderitems/(id)/ PUT

In order to change order items fields like `driver` assigned. You need to provide the payload containing either the `driver` id or `status`.

```json

  {
    "status": "completed"
  }

```

The `status` must be one of the following options: -- `completed`, `pending` or `cancelled`. The client must send one of the following as the current status: `completed`, `pending` or `cancelled`.
When an order is saved, the status of the each item in the items array is `pending`. The client can update it using the above endpoint.


### Assigning Drivers to orderitems via a PUT request.
  
## /api/orderitems/drivers/assign/?option=add_driver PUT
## Or
## /api/orderitems/drivers/assign/?option=remove_driver PUT
 In order to successfully assign a driver to an orderitem, the `id` of the item and driver must be sent to the backend in the following payload:

```json
{
  "orderitem_id": 1,
  "driver_id": 1
}

```
The `option` parameter is required. It tells the backend service what it is you are trying to do.
The `option` parameter should be one of two values: `add_driver` or `remove_driver`.
To `add_driver` means you are trying to assign driver to a particular orderitem instance.
To `remove_driver` means the opposite.

The two parameters in the payload, `orderitem_id` and `driver_id` respectively, are the unique `id` of both the driver and the orderitem in question. 

The `driver_id` field should be the id of the driver you wish to assign.
The `orderitem_id` field, on the other hand, should be the id of the orderitem you wish to modify.

To add driver, you should send the payload to `/api/orderitems/drivers/assign/?option=add_driver` with the above payload.
To remove driver, you should send the payload to `/api/orderitems/drivers/assign/?option=remove_driver`


### Expected Success Response:
```json
{"message": "Driver: jake@gmail.com assigned successfully to ordered item"}

```

### Expected Error Response:
```json
{"message": "driver_id field is required."}
{"message": "option query parameter is required."}
{"message": "User must be a restaurant"}
{"message": "Order item does not exist"}
{"message": "Driver with id: {driver_id} does not exist your restaurant"}
{"message": "Select a valid option --- add_driver or remove_driver"}

```
